                <p>Psychiatrists are seeing an increase in the number of patients who are going crazy because they think they're on secret reality shows. One subject is even suing HBO for "filming and broadcasting a hidden camera reality show depicting the day-to-day activities of plaintiff" without consent.</p>
<p>This "Truman Show" delusion could have all been avoided if everyone would just watch real TV shows like Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, and Mad Men.</p>

<p>These photos also clearly show some of the features of the next-generation iPhone. The long rumored smaller dock connector is present, the earphone jack has been moved to the bottom corner of the device (the first time Apple has done this on one of their smartphones), the speaker grills have been redesigned, and there is a new opening between the camera lens and the LED flash.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow, this is a pretty big leak—and early—since most are saying the next iPhone isn't going to be released until October. 9to5Mac claims it has somewhat of a unibody enclosure, like the current generation MacBooks. I think it looks pretty good. </p>
<p>I'm hoping these pictures are an indication that it's almost ready for release, because this worn out home button on my iPhone 4 is driving me nuts. Maybe it'll be introduced at WWDC in June?</p>

                <p>I've finally gotten around to making my dream blog! I now have a snappy little site that is simple and allows me to post from any computer or iOS device I have in front of me. </p>
<p>Thanks to Marco Arment's awesome <a href="https://github.com/marcoarment/secondcrack">Second Crack</a>, all I do is to save a markdown draft to my dropbox. From there, Second Crack instantly creates a nice static preview html file that allows me to view my post exactly as it will appear when I commit it. When the post's ready to be published, I just move it into the <code>_publish-now/</code> directory or add a header that says "publish-now" in the markdown file. And it's done!</p>
<p>Marco has posted an awesome <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu5uXXulnNk">video demo</a> of this greatness in action.<sup id="fnref:blog"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:blog" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Installing Second Crack wasn't the easiest thing in the world, but thanks to Nick Wynja's awesome <a href="https://github.com/nickwynja/deploysecondcrack"><code>deploysecondcrack</code></a> and through <a href="http://nickwynja.com/deploysecondcrack">instructions</a>, it's definitely doable. Anyone with moderate SSH and command line knowledge can figure it out.</p>
<p>Because of it's simplicity, I'm hoping it encourages me to blog more often. Also, be prepared for drastic changes to the look and functionality of this blog in the coming weeks. Due to my amateur web development knowledge, some stuff will probably be broken too. But hey, <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/innovation/facebook-philosophy-move-fast-and-break-things">move fast and break things</a>, right?</p>

<p>There's some nifty bookmarklet action in the video — I haven't gotten around to messing with these yet. However, there's instructions for doing so on Marco's <a href="https://github.com/marcoarment/secondcrack">github</a> page.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:blog" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
