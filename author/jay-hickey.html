                        <p>I love the <a href="http://loomilight.com/">Loomi</a> light that my sister got me for christmas. It looks so cool, and the DIY aspect of putting it together just adds to the fun. Here's how the creators describe the Loomi on their <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/623521323/loomi-a-modular-light-of-paper">Kickstarter page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Loomi is a modular, makeable, paintable, recyclable light that looks beautiful just about anywhere. Loomi is made up of interlinking quadrilaterals that easily connect to create wonderful lights of all shapes and sizes. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was gifted the kickstarter single light kit with electrical fixture. You get a pack of thirty three quadrilateral cutouts that you can use to build whatever you want. They feel identical to high quality posterboard. I wouldn't be surprised if that what it's cut from.</p>
<p><img alt="Loomi Kit" src="http://jayhickey.com/media/2011/12/loomi_package.jpg" /></p>
<p>I chose to make the Loomi Globe, mainly because that was the only creation they had posted <a href="http://loomilight.com/instructions/loomi_instructions.pdf">instructions</a> for. I used all but three of the cutouts to build the globe. It was a little challenging to make, and at times I was afraid I might rip an edge. Regardless, I had a great time hooking the pieces together.</p>
<p><img alt="My Loomi" src="http://jayhickey.com/media/2011/12/loomi_on.jpg" /></p>
<p>The Loomi looks fantastic once you slip the light fixture in and turn on the light. I thought the photos on Loomi's website looked too good to be true, but it <em>really looks that awesome.</em></p>
<p>Everyone in my family wants one now. I've never seen a light that gave off such a unique, relaxing hue. I can't wait to hang the Loomi up when I get back to school.</p>

                        <p>I've finally gotten around to making my dream blog! I now have a snappy little site that is simple and allows me to post from any computer or iOS device I have in front of me. </p>
<p>Thanks to Marco Arment's awesome <a href="https://github.com/marcoarment/secondcrack">Second Crack</a>, all I do is to save a markdown draft to my dropbox. From there, Second Crack instantly creates a nice static preview html file that allows me to view my post exactly as it will appear when I commit it. When the post's ready to be published, I just move it into the <code>_publish-now/</code> directory or add a header that says "publish-now" in the markdown file. And it's done!</p>
<p>Marco has posted an awesome <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu5uXXulnNk">video demo</a> of this greatness in action.<sup id="fnref:blog"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:blog" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Installing Second Crack wasn't the easiest thing in the world, but thanks to Nick Wynja's awesome <a href="https://github.com/nickwynja/deploysecondcrack"><code>deploysecondcrack</code></a> and through <a href="http://nickwynja.com/deploysecondcrack">instructions</a>, it's definitely doable. Anyone with moderate SSH and command line knowledge can figure it out.</p>
<p>Because of it's simplicity, I'm hoping it encourages me to blog more often. Also, be prepared for drastic changes to the look and functionality of this blog in the coming weeks. Due to my amateur web development knowledge, some stuff will probably be broken too. But hey, <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/innovation/facebook-philosophy-move-fast-and-break-things">move fast and break things</a>, right?</p>

                        <blockquote>
<p>These photos also clearly show some of the features of the next-generation iPhone. The long rumored smaller dock connector is present, the earphone jack has been moved to the bottom corner of the device (the first time Apple has done this on one of their smartphones), the speaker grills have been redesigned, and there is a new opening between the camera lens and the LED flash.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow, this is a pretty big leak—and early—since most are saying the next iPhone isn't going to be released until October. 9to5Mac claims it has somewhat of a unibody enclosure, like the current generation MacBooks. I think it looks pretty good. </p>
<p>I'm hoping these pictures are an indication that it's almost ready for release, because this worn out home button on my iPhone 4 is driving me nuts. Maybe it'll be introduced at WWDC in June?</p>

                        <p>Psychiatrists are seeing an increase in the number of patients who are going crazy because they think they're on secret reality shows. One subject is even suing HBO for "filming and broadcasting a hidden camera reality show depicting the day-to-day activities of plaintiff" without consent.</p>
<p>This "Truman Show" delusion could have all been avoided if everyone would just watch real TV shows like Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, and Mad Men.</p>

<p>There's four versions with different jokes, so make sure to watch them all at <a href="http://www.disney.com/MonstersUniversity">Disney</a>, <a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/disney/monstersuniversity">Apple</a>, <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/monsters-university/trailers/monsters-university-teaser-trailer-29717274.html">Yahoo</a>, and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/20/monsters-university-trailer-teaser-video_n_1610673.html">Huffington Post</a>. The Apple one is my favorite:</p>

                        <p>An unprecedented tie:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sprinters Jeneba Tarmoh and Allyson Felix appeared to finish third and fourth in the final of the women's 100-meter dash, but the state of the art cameras — that shoot at 3,000 frames per <em>second</em> — showed that they actually crossed the finish line at the exact same time. Normally, that wouldn't be such a big deal except that the race was also being used to determine the runners who will represent the U.S. at the London Olympics next month. The U.S. is only allowed to send three runners and number four will watch from home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is nuts! Tarmoh and Felix ran a time of 11.07 seconds. Taking it an extra decimal place, they were still tied at 11.068. It's coming down to either a run-off or a coin toss. Both women have the same coach, and are competing in the 200m dash as well (finals are this Friday at 9:50 PM EST). So if at least one of them qualifies in the 200, hopefully they'll let the other go in the 100. Having all your hopes and dreams of the Olympics come down to a <em>coin toss?</em>  I couldn't even imagine.</p>

                        </header>

                        <p>So far, <a href="https://github.com/marcoarment/secondcrack">Second Crack</a> has been really nice for blogging. The included bookmarklets have been indispensable for drafting quick links from my iPhone or iPad, but there's no easy way to post videos. I watch tons of videos on the web, and would love to be able to share them here. So I created a bookmarklet that makes it simple to do that.</p>
<p>This is the first time I've ever worked with PHP, so I'm definitely out of my comfort zone. But I'm pleased with my implementation. The bulk of the functionality relies on two functions:</p>
<p><code>get_html</code> uses <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">cURL</a> to easily return the HTML of the current page as a string:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="x">   
    <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">get_html</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$url</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nv">$ch</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">curl_init</span><span class="p">();</span>
        <span class="nv">$timeout</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="nb">curl_setopt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$ch</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nx">CURLOPT_URL</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nv">$url</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="nb">curl_setopt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$ch</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nx">CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="nb">curl_setopt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$ch</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nx">CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nv">$timeout</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="nv">$data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">curl_exec</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$ch</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="nb">curl_close</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$ch</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nv">$data</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

</pre></div>

<p>Pretty straightforward. By setting <code>CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER</code> to TRUE, <code>curl_exec</code> is returned as a string instead of being output directly.</p>
<p><code>video_embed</code> finds the ID of the video and returns an HTML iframe for embedding:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="x">

   <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">video_embed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$html</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nv">$vimeo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">array</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;#player.vimeo.com/video/([0-9]*)#i&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="nv">$youtube</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">array</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;#/embed/([0-9a-z_-]+)#i&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;#youtu.be/([0-9a-z_-]+)#i&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>                 <span class="s1">&#39;#/v/([0-9a-z_-]+)#i&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;#v=([0-9a-z_-]+)#i&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>

</pre></div>

<p>The first two lines create arrays of regex patterns for video IDs of both embedded and non-embedded videos.<sup id="fnref:SC"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:SC" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p><code>preg_match</code> then searches for a match in the HTML and returns an array called <code>$id</code>. <code>$id[0]</code> has the full text of the regex match and <code>$id[1]</code> has the text that matches the first captured parenthesized subpattern (i.e., just the video ID). Upon a match, embed code is returned with <code>$id[1]</code>'s value in place.</p>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This bookmarklet only works for <strong>YouTube</strong> and <strong>Vimeo</strong> videos. Pretty much all of my online video viewing is from these two services, so I'm fine with this limitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any selected text will also be included in the draft as a blockquote. If no video is found on the current page, the bookmarklet functions just like Second Crack's included "Draft Link".</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://jayhickey.com/media/2012/06/add-video.zip">Download</a></strong> the source for the bookmarklet and install it the same way as <a href="https://github.com/marcoarment/secondcrack#posting-with-bookmarklets">Marco instructs</a>. If you already have the other bookmarklets setup, just place <code>add-video.php</code> in the same directory and navigate to, e.g.:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nl">http:</span><span class="c1">//admin.myblog.com/add-video.php</span>
</pre></div>


<p>and install the bookmarklet from there.</p>
<p>Alternatively, I've added this to the existing "Draft Article" and "Draft Link" bookmarklet code. This conveniently keeps all the bookmarklets together and in one file. See the full source at my fork on <a href="https://github.com/jayhickey/secondcrack/blob/master/api-www/add-draft.php">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I'm open to all ideas on improving the existing regex, expanding the functionality to other video services, or anything that will make this better. <a href="http://jayhickey.com/about">Get in touch</a>.</p>

<p>I excitedly told my boss that I thought I could automate this painful and tedious process (which had to be done several times a year). I can’t remember her specific words, but she basically told me to stop working on that and just do it the way they had been: she didn’t believe it was going to work and thought it was a waste of time.</p>
<p>Well, double f--- that. A couple more hours of applied effort and I had a macro that looped through all the images in a directory tree and laid them out in Excel. I spent the next four days surfing the web and handing out files.</p>
<p>This is why I encourage everyone to learn some basic programming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've independently created a program just like this at a job, and remember my manager initially saying something very similar. Not only does it get the task done faster, but there's something very satisfying about saving yourself and other people boatloads of time with a program.</p>

                        <p>Turns out, a large amount of <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/frontal-cortex/2012/06/daniel-kahneman-bias-studies.html"><em>The New Yorker</em> piece</a> that I <a href="http://jayhickey.com/2012/06/16/why-smart-people-are-stupid">linked to</a> last week consisted of recycled material: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The victim: Jonah Lehrer. The newly minted New Yorker staff writer’s June 12 blog post “Why Smart People Are Stupid” copied, at times word for word, three paragraphs from Lehrer’s 2011 Wall Street Journal story “The Science of Irrationality.” A few hours later, New York’s Joe Coscarelli and writer Jacob Silverman discovered a bunch more instances in which Lehrer 
reheated his leftovers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Journalists found out today that <a href="http://www.edrants.com/how-jonah-lehrer-recycled-his-own-material-for-imagine/">Lehrer's been doing this for years</a>. In 2006, he even plagiarized excerpts from an essay by fellow <em>New Yorker</em> colleague Malcolm Gladwell. So apparently, pressing ⌘-C then ⌘-V makes you a journalist now.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple arithmetic question: A bat and ball cost a dollar and ten cents. The bat costs a dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?</p>

<p>I jumped the gun and got it wrong. But wait, does that make me stupid? Or smart?</p>

                        <p>Super handy script by my buddy Tim Bueno. Grabs all of your past tweets (well, the last 3200) and whips them together into a nice plain text file. Chuck the text file from Tim's script into Dropbox, combine it with this <a href="http://ifttt.com/recipes/37991">IFTTT Recipe</a>, and everything new you tweet will be appended, keeping it up to date. Love it.</p>
<p>It never hurts to have a local backup of the digital information that matters to you. Especially when it's a free service you don't pay for, like Twitter. One day, everything might disappear.</p>

                        <p>The technology is accurate to between 10 centimeters and two meters, uses your phone's compass, and <em>no upfront infrastructure</em> is needed: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indoor Atlas's technology works by analyzing the magnetic field inside a building. The structure of a building causes disturbances to the Earth's magnetic field. Once these disturbances are mapped, people can be pinpointed within them through their phone's magnetometer. Indoor Atlas's product arose from research findings that showed the signature magnetic field within buildings was sufficiently varied and stable to be used for navigation, says company founder and computer science professor Janne Haverinen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this works as advertised, the possibilities are endless. An app could route you around a store based on your shopping list, automatically checking off the items as you go. Or let you find exactly where your friend is in a busy shopping mall. And businesses don't have to drop the dough to fill the place with WiFi or NFC antennas. I often use the excellent <a href="http://aisle411.com/">aisle411</a> app for in-store navigation at my local Kroger. But the lack of a "blue dot" showing my present location within in the store results in me staring too long at my phone, trying not to block the isle.</p>
<p>This would dramatically improve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo-fence">geofencing</a> too. I constantly take advantage of the nearby contexts features of <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus-iphone/">Omnifocus for iPhone</a>, such as setting reminders for leaving or arriving at my work and home. It's also great for setting specific searches as locations, such as "Grocery Store" or "Walgreens" (I look forward to giving the just released, "iOS Reminders on streoids" app, <a href="http://builtbysnowman.com/">Checkmark</a>, a spin too). There's a constant vexation with this geofencing though. To save battery, it doesn't use full GPS. So it isn't accurate enough, especially indoors. I find myself only setting "arriving" reminders, because the "leaving" reminder to grab the package I need to take to FedEx doesn't end up going off until I'm already in my car and heading down the road. But add integration with this Indoor Atlas technology, and the alert could go off the second I step out the front door. We're at the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the potential of geofencing, and as a impressively forgetful person, I can't wait to see this take off.</p>

                        <p>I can't get enough of these "video game turned movie" posters. I especially like the <em>Portal</em> one—nice subtle details. Story by Eddy Kitsis and Adam Horowitz (<em>Lost</em> writers), Joseph Kosinski (of <em>TRON: Legacy</em> fame) as the director, and of course starring Natalie Portman. Oh how happy I would be if this got made.</p>
